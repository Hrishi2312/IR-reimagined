# IR-reimagined

IR-reimagined is a combination of our Semester 8 NLP Project and CC Project wherein the NLP Project's functionality working in python has been translated over to a django website in order to be hosted at Heroku.
This project can be described as a simplified search engine which is used to retrieve documents consisting the words the user searches in the search bar.
